⚡ Course Vibe

🎬 Story-driven backend engineering🛠️ Hands-on + real-world workflows🧠 No theory overload🔥 Production-first mindset

Backend development is not about writing APIs.It’s about designing systems that survive real users.

🧩 Teaching Style (Animated Flow)

➡️ Problem appears➡️ Break it down➡️ Design the backend logic➡️ Code it live➡️ Debug like a pro➡️ Optimize & secure
